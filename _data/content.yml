    I'm a senior software developer from Iasi, Romania with a master's degree in Business Information Systems. <br>
    Day by day I'm working with PHP and Symfony framework but along the time I got also in contact with other popular
    frameworks such as Laravel, Zend, Codeigniter. <br>
    With over 5 years experience in this field I'm enjoying helping people achieve their goals through the use of
    technology.
