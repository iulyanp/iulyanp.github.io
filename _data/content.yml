    I'm a senior software developer from Iasi, Romania with a master's degree in Business Information Systems. <br>
    Day by day I'm working with PHP and Symfony framework but along the time I got also in contact with other popular
    frameworks such as Laravel, Zend, Codeigniter. <br>
    With over 5 years experience in this field I'm enjoying helping people achieve their goals through the use of
    technology.

    <p>Hello, my name is Iulian (Pronuntiation: <a href="http://www.pronouncenames.com/pronounce/Iulian" target="_blank">Iulian</a>).</p>
    <p>I am a young and ambitious Senior Web Developer graduated in 2014 at Al. I. Cuza University, with a master degree in Business Information Systems.</p>
    <p>My focus is on building amazing web applications leveraging many open source technologies. I have experience in designing and optimizing databases, software engineering and software development.  Along the time, I have proven my abilities to quickly adapt to new projects and technologies.
    I always look to improve my software and project management skills because I like to be up-to-date with the latest technologies.</p>
    <p>Personaly I think programming is about writing code using your brain, that's why I take pride in every single line written. I also consider testing and code reviews to be an important area on every project.</p>
    <p>Currently I'm working as a technical lead/senior web developer, for a company that provides IT outsourcing and consulting services.</p>
    <p>Most of my work is related, in one way or another, with helping people understand and use technology to easily solve their problems.</p>
