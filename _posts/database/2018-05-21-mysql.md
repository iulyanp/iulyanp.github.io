MySQL is one of the most popular sql databases, it is a powerfull, free open-source database management system that 
has been around for years. MySQL powers 9 of the 10 top Web sites worldwide, as well as thousands of corporate 
web-based applications. MySQL was designed and optimized for Web applications, that's why it became the favorite 
choice for web developers.

In this post I'm making a list with the most useful MySQL commands you should know.

#### Create a new mysql database
```
CREATE DATABASE dbname;
```

#### Drop an existing database

```
DROP DATABASE dbname;
```

#### Create a new user and give him rights on a specific database

```
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `dbname`.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `dbname`.* TO 'user'@'127.2.1.%';
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```

#### Grant full user rights on all databases

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
```

#### Update a mysql user password

```
UPDATE mysql.user SET PASSWORD=PASSWORD('newpassword') WHERE USER='user';
```

#### Delete a mysql user

```
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE USER='user' AND HOST='localhost';
```

#### Dump your database to a sql file

```
mysqldump -u root -p dbname > dbname-bk.sql
```

##### This will temporary block writes to your database 

```
mysqldump --routines --triggers --events -u root dbname > dbname-bk.sql
```

#### Restore your backup

```
mysql -u root -p dbname < dbname.sql
```

#### Restore one single database from a dump with multiple databases

```
mysql -u root --force --one-database dbname < dump-dbs.sql
```

#### Update root password

```
sudo systemctl stop mysql

# or
sudo service mysql stop

sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables & mysql -u root

use mysql;

UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('parolanoua') WHERE user='root';
flush privileges;
quit

mysqladmin -uroot -p shutdown
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
```
#### Kill all processes of a specific user

```
SELECT concat('KILL ',id,';') FROM information_schema.processlist WHERE user='user';
```
