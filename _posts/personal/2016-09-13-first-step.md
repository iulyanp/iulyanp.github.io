Finally, I decided to give it a try and create my fist blog. Because I want it to be someting very simple, I ended up working with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Writing rich content in Markdown it's by far the fastest and cleaneast method than almost any other.

### What's Jekyll?
Jekyll is a static site generator, for creating simple blogs and of course it's an open-source tool. <br>
I highly recommend it if you want a simple blog up and running within minutes.

### Intro
Because I'm not so experienced in how to start my first blog post I will just make a short introduction of what I want this blog to be about.

### What you'll find here...

First of all I want to clarify that all the information you'll find on this blog is just my way of seeing things. <br>
I will talk about my favorite framkework "Symfony" but also about other technologies that I usualy use such as: *PHP*, *GIT*, *MySQL*, *Docker*, *Nginx*, *Javascript*, *CSS*, *OOP*. <br>
If you are anything like me and you like things like Linux, APIs, server configurations and web tools you're on the right 
place and I hope you'll find something to take home with you.
